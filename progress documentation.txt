Step1. Installation

While installing vue through npm, there were some dependency issues.
Resolved by making --legacy--peer-deps true.


Step2. Issue between Bootstrapvue and Vue3 and trying to retrieve data

Found out that bootstrapvue does not work correctly under vue3.
Approaching how to retrieve data from the api.
xhr json parse was considered, however i found out that
Vue has axios that can import data from url based api.
Using axios to get the api and display the data.
Used <table> to display data using v-for condition.
I have successfully displayed data on Vue3 project, however in order to use bootstrap,
I restarted the project on vue2.


Step3. Using bootstrapvue to make pagination and search function

On vue2 I have successfully imported the bootstrapvue and implemented
<b-pagination> and <b-table> instead of <table>
by looking up and learning from https://bootstrap-vue.org and https://vuejs.org/.

Implementing search by options and display items per page by choice was
also implemented through bootstrapvue by tweaking the sample code.


Step4. Testing

Tested searching with and without the filter on. Tested pagination.
Checked if data showed is correct by comparing random data with the api.


#What was hard and what I have learned from this exercise.

I have learned that when I was given the list of frameworks to use, I should check version dependencies
before installing the up-to-date version.
Also, even though I have some experience in React, Vue was a new experience and there was a learning curve.
I have really enjoyed finding out the differences between them.
It has taken me approximately 3 hours to complete, however I may have been able to finish it faster
if I was more cautious about using the right version of Vue.
